<p>In his Ted Talk, one of the pioneers of data art, Aaron Koblin made a clever note that &ldquo;19th century culture was defined by the novel, 20th century by the cinema, and the culture of the 21st century will be defined by the interface.&rdquo; In keeping with this &ldquo;evolutionary process&rdquo;, Koblin&rsquo;s data projects uniquely stand out for the fact that they blur the lines between art, interface, and information. One of his earliest projects was the mapping of U.S. domestic airline flights within a twenty four hour period. This mapping resulted in an absolutely beautiful visual/artistic representation whilst at the same time displayed the incredible organization of U.S. domestic air traffic. This directly affirms Kamvar and Harris&rsquo;s claim in &ldquo;We Feel Fine and Searching the Emotional Web&rdquo; that data visualization can be used for more than exposing patterns in data, as in Koblin&rsquo;s case where the data visualization was used for art.</p>
