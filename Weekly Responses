<p>First Response - Bio</p>

<p>In a nutshell, my name is Shandon Fleming, I am 20 years old, and I am from the island of St. Maarten. 
I am currently in my third year of the Computation Arts Specialization and without a doubt, my strengths/what 
I enjoy the most in this field is graphic design and animation.</p>

<p>Response For Week 3</p>

<p>In my process of digesting the subject of crowdsourcing (the practice of obtaining information or input into a task or project by enlisting the services of a large number of people, either paid or unpaid, typically via the internet), my attention was almost immediately drawn towards the world's most famous encyclopedia known as Wikipedia. Correlating with Jeff Howe's critique of the then rising field of crowdsourcing back in 2006, we can now take a look at the giant of Wikipedia as a real world example 16 years later and see how this method of growing and developing a project, platform, etc. via the &quot;chipping in&quot; of multiple contributors is not only functional, but practical and effective.</p>
