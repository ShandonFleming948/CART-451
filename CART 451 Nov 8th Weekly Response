An example of one of Anadol’s data sculptures is an piece known as “Machine Hallucinations”. He started by gathering 113 million images of New York online, and then let the “machine” learn from the entire pool of data. Anadol also went a step further and removed all of the images that included humans so that the AI could only focus on the buildings, the nature, and the environment that makes up the collective memory of New York. This then left him with 10 million pictures of the city. Those pictures were then fed through a machine learning algorithm that generates visual associations as it learns. For example, when the machine sees multiple photos of the statue of liberty taken from slightly different angles, the algorithm interpolates the information to help it create a moving, shifting image that represents the entire life cycle of the structure. Anadol then covered the walls and the floor of a boiler room in lower Manhattan with this machine interpreted dynamic landscape.
